# CatCalZone Jenkins Job Definitions

These are the Jenkins Jobs for CatCalZone.

They are defined via the [Jenkins Job DSL Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin).

Changes on the `master` branch of this repository are applied by the [seed job](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL#1-creating-the-seed-job)
every 5 minutes.
